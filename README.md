# Advent of Code 2024: Zig

Yee, trying out this language with a few of the problems from last years advent
of code. Really enjoying the language so far. Passing allocators into functions
is such a fab way to reason about memory allocation. You know exactly what's
going on.

Will definitely be reaching for this language a lot more than Rust from now on.
This language is actually fun to work in.
